## Phase -1: The Debut

This is the initial phase of my nearly two-year-long data science roadmap. During this phase, I’ve dedicated myself to learning fundamental and intermediate-level statistics, some mathematical concepts, and the essential modules of Python. These modules are crucial for data analysis and data science workflows.

Due to obvious reasons, I can’t share my mathematical and theoretical learnings here. However, I’m happy to share my code and Jupyter notebooks that I created while learning various modules. You can find them in the designated folders.

Wish me luck for the next phases !!
