# 🚀 My Data Science Journey

Welcome to the official repository where I document my complete learning journey toward Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. This repo is more than just code – it's the real-time reflection of my growth, hustle.

## 📜 Background

In early 2025, I made the decision to follow a focused roadmap tailored around my current reality:

- I'm a student from Bangladesh with no Olympiad medals or global competition wins.
- I'm not someone who learns well from thick textbooks — instead, I work hands-on, experiment, break things, fix them, and then learn.
- My dream is to become a **Computer Engineer** specializing in **AI/ML**, and I’m ready to build the path from the ground up.
- I’m serious about getting into a solid university *with full aid* by proving my skill through real projects, public work, and a strong portfolio.
- I previously went in a different path with another roadmap, which you can also see in my GitHub profile.[Click](https://github.com/ByteBard58/My-Python-Journey) here to check it out. I decided to transition into a full data science roadmap, where my goal will be to be a proper Data Scientist and AI/ML developer.

## 📌 The Roadmap I'm Following

This repo follows a **phase-based roadmap** designed based on industry guidance, realistic timeframes, and my long-term goal. This roadmap was generated by using ChatGPT's **deep research** capability and with very deep instruction. You can find the PDF file of it [here](https://github.com/ByteBard58/Data-Science-Rodamp/blob/main/ChatGPT%20Doc.pdf)

Here is a short glimpse of the roadmap:

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (✔ Completed Early – Target was July 16)
- Core Python, Git, CLI
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib/seaborn for data viz
- Stats/probability essentials
- Mini-projects and practice notebooks
- All work now organized and ready to go public

### ⏳ Phase 2: Core Data Science Skills (Currently Starting)
- Supervised ML (linear/logistic regression, KNN, trees, etc.)
- Feature engineering, preprocessing, hypothesis testing
- Intermediate Kaggle challenges
- Project reports and blogs

### 🔜 Later Phases
- Advanced ML, intro to deep learning, NLP/CV
- Model deployment
- Domain specialization (NLP, CV, etc.)
- Capstone project and open-source involvement

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (Phase 1)
- sklearn, numpy, scipy, etc. (Coming in Phase 2+)

## 🧠 Notes to Self

This repo is not about perfection. It’s about **progress**. About **doing** instead of over-planning.  
Everything here will evolve — refactors will happen, ideas will change, and skills will level up.  
But one thing will stay constant: **I’m not quitting**.
